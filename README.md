#### 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a software developer driven to build AI-powered tools that streamline workflows and help future colleagues focus on meaningful work. Whether it's automating the mundane or designing smarter solutions, I believe technology should free us up for what really matters.

- **Languages:** Python (pro), some web dev, and basic machine learning.
- **Philosophy:** If it’s boring or repetitive, automate it! My mission: maximize efficiency and minimize tediousness.

#### 🔥 Projects I’m Proud Of

- **Python Card Game**  
  A strategic, turn-based card game with unique status effects, dynamic turn mechanics, and dice-rolling simulations.  
  *Why I built it:* To blend coding with game design — and test creative logic!

- **Finance Scraping Telegram Bot**  
  A bot that regularly fetches and delivers the latest financial news to Telegram, keeping me (and perhaps others soon!) informed without the manual grind.  
  *Why I built it:* Smart, real-time info at your fingertips beats endless browsing.
